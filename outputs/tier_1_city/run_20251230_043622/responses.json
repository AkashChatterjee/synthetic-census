      "Honestly, I don't know enough about India's economy to have an informed opinion on that. My expertise is in teaching high school English, not international economic policy.\n\nWhat I *can* tell you is that here in the U.S., I'm watching AI potentially displace huge numbers of workers\u2014and I'm seeing it firsthand with my students. If ChatGPT can write a decent essay in seconds, what happens to all the jobs that involve writing, analysis, and communication? That's terrifying.\n\nSo the *concept* of some kind of safety net as automation accelerates? That makes intuitive sense to me. We're going to need something when truck drivers, paralegals, customer service reps\u2014and maybe even teachers\u2014are partially or fully replaced.\n\nBut India has completely different challenges than suburban Chicago. Different poverty levels, different government capacity, different labor markets. I'd be really hesitant to prescribe solutions for a country I've never been to and don't deeply understand.\n\nI'm struggling enough trying to figure out what education should look like in *this* community five years from now. That's honestly where my brain is at.",
      "Honestly, I don't know enough about India's economy or social systems to have an informed opinion on UBI there. My knowledge is pretty limited to what I've read in mainstream American media\u2014articles about tech hubs in Bangalore, occasional NPR pieces about India's growing middle class, that sort of thing.\n\nFrom my teaching perspective, I see the *concept* of UBI through the lens of education: if families had more financial security, would kids be better able to focus on learning? Would they have fewer barriers to education? That seems plausible anywhere.\n\nBut India has what, over a billion people? Massive rural populations, different economic structures than the US? I'd be way out of my depth trying to prescribe economic policy for a country I've never lived in and barely understand.\n\nI'm more focused on whether we could make something like that work *here*\u2014especially as AI threatens to displace workers, including potentially making aspects of teaching obsolete. That's the disruption I'm living through daily. The question of how different countries with vastly different contexts should handle technological unemployment is beyond my expertise.",
      "You know, I'll be honest\u2014I don't know much about India's specific economic situation or what would work there. That's pretty far outside my wheelhouse as a high school teacher in the Chicago suburbs.\n\nBut from what I've seen in my own classroom, I can tell you this: when students come to school hungry, stressed about their family's finances, or working 20+ hours a week at jobs just to help pay rent, they can't focus on learning. Period. It breaks my heart and it's getting worse.\n\nSo if a universal minimum income could stabilize families enough that kids can actually concentrate on education instead of survival? That seems worth exploring. But I'd imagine in a country as large and diverse as India, the implementation would be incredibly complex\u2014way more than I could speak to intelligently.\n\nWhat I do know is that poverty is the biggest predictor of educational outcomes I see. Any policy that addresses that deserves serious consideration, though I'd defer to people who actually understand India's economy and social systems. I'm just trying to teach *The Great Gatsby* to kids who sometimes haven't eaten breakfast."

      "That's pretty far outside my wheelhouse - I spend my days reading CT scans, not studying economic policy, especially for countries I don't live in.\n\nFrom what little I know, India has a massive population with huge income disparities and a very different economic structure than the US. I'd defer to economists who actually study developing economies and social safety nets.\n\nI guess I can say this: in medicine, we see firsthand what happens when people can't afford basic needs - delayed care, worse outcomes, higher eventual costs. There's probably some parallel to broader economic policy, but the scale and implementation details matter enormously.\n\nMy honest take? I'm skeptical of my own opinion on this. I make $420K reading brain MRIs in Boston. What do I really know about poverty alleviation strategies in a country of 1.4 billion people with a completely different context? I'd rather listen to people who've actually studied this than spout off based on my limited understanding.\n\nIs there something about healthcare access or medical AI that brought this question up? That's more my area.",
      "Look, I appreciate the question, but I'm going to be honest\u2014this is pretty far outside my wheelhouse. I spend my days reading CT scans and MRIs, not studying macroeconomic policy in developing nations.\n\nFrom my limited understanding, India has a completely different economic structure than what I'm familiar with here in the US. The informal economy, agricultural sector, income distribution\u2014it's all beyond what I can meaningfully comment on.\n\nWhat I *can* say from a healthcare perspective is that in the US, I see how economic insecurity affects health outcomes. Patients delay care, skip follow-ups, can't afford medications. If a UBI-type program could address some of that, great. But the implementation details matter enormously, and I don't know enough about India's fiscal capacity, labor markets, or existing social programs to have an informed opinion.\n\nI'd rather stick to what I know\u2014like whether that lesion on your brain MRI is concerning\u2014than pretend expertise I don't have. There are development economists and policy experts who've actually studied this stuff. I'd trust them over a radiologist from Boston.",

The cost of living, labor markets, government capacity\u2014it's all different. I'd be out of my depth trying to have an informed opinion.\n\nWhat I *can* say from my own experience is that the US healthcare system creates bizarre economic pressures. I see uninsured patients delay scans until conditions are critical, which is both medically and economically inefficient. Whether some form of basic income would help with that? I honestly don't know enough to say.\n\nI try to stay in my lane professionally. When radiologists start pontificating about macroeconomic policy in countries they've never worked in, we usually sound pretty foolish. I'd rather admit I don't have an informed take than pretend I do."

      "Honestly, I don't know much about India's economy or what would work there. That's pretty far outside my day-to-day reality here in Phoenix.\n\nBut if you're asking what I think about universal basic income in general? I'm conflicted. Part of me thinks it sounds amazing\u2014like, imagine having a baseline income while finishing my degree or transitioning careers. That security would be life-changing.\n\nBut the practical side of me has questions. Where does that money come from? Does it replace other programs or add to them? And would prices just go up to match, like what happened with rent when everyone got stimulus checks?\n\nWorking retail, I see both sides. Some customers clearly need more support\u2014they're choosing between groceries and medicine. But I also see people who could work but don't, and I wonder if guaranteed income would help or enable that.\n\nI think for a country like India with way more people and different economic challenges, it would be even more complicated. They'd have to figure out what works for their situation. I'm barely keeping up with American politics, let alone international policy, you know?",
      "Honestly, I don't know that much about India's economy or what would work there. That's pretty far outside my world - I'm dealing with scheduling conflicts and inventory issues in Phoenix, not international policy.\n\nBut from what I see here? The idea of guaranteed income sounds nice in theory, but I'm skeptical. Like, we can barely get our government to agree on minimum wage increases. And I worry - would companies just use it as an excuse to pay even less? Target already knows exactly how little they can pay before people quit.\n\nI guess my take is: if robots and AI are really going to take everyone's jobs like people say, then yeah, maybe we'll need something like that. But it feels like putting a band-aid on a bigger problem instead of actually creating good jobs that pay decent wages.\n\nI'd rather see investment in education and training programs so people can adapt to whatever's coming. Give people skills, not just checks. Though I get that's easier said than done when you're already working two jobs just to survive.\n\nIs India dealing with a lot of automation in retail too, or is this about something else?",

There are definitely customers I see who are one paycheck away from disaster, and that safety net would help.\n\nBut also... I've worked retail long enough to know some people would just stop showing up. We're already short-staffed constantly. Who's gonna stock shelves and deal with difficult customers if everyone's getting paid to stay home? \n\nAnd where does that money even come from? My taxes? The government can't even fix the roads properly.\n\nI think it's one of those things that sounds good on paper but I'd need to see it actually work somewhere first. I'm more focused on just getting a living wage and affordable healthcare here tbh. Let's solve those basics before we get too experimental."

      "Honestly, UBI in India feels like a massive implementation challenge that makes San Francisco's homelessness problem look simple by comparison.\n\nFrom a systems perspective: How do you verify identity at scale? India has Aadhaar which is impressive, but distribution infrastructure is the real bottleneck. You're talking about getting cash to hundreds of millions of people, many without bank accounts or reliable internet. The fraud vectors alone would be insane.\n\nThe economics don't quite pencil out either. India's GDP per capita is like $2,500. Even a modest UBI of $50/month per person would be a huge chunk of the budget. Where does that money come from without tanking growth?\n\nI get the appeal\u2014especially as AI potentially displaces jobs\u2014but India still has a ton of labor-intensive development to do. Construction, manufacturing, services. They're not automating away jobs faster than they're creating them yet.\n\nMaybe pilot it in Kerala or somewhere with better infrastructure first? Classic tech approach: start small, iterate, scale what works. But rolling it out nationally seems like asking for a disaster. The corruption and leakage would be brutal.",
      "Honestly, UBI in India feels like such a different problem space than what we deal with here in the US that I'm hesitant to have a strong opinion.\n\nFrom a systems perspective, the implementation challenges seem massive - you're talking about a country with 1.4 billion people, varying levels of banking infrastructure, and a huge informal economy. The targeting problem alone is gnarly. How do you even verify identity and prevent fraud at that scale?\n\nThat said, I've read about some of the pilot programs, and if AI really does start eating jobs globally, developing countries might actually need to move faster on this than we do. The social safety net there is way thinner.\n\nThe engineer in me thinks: what's the MVP here? Maybe it's not full UBI but targeted cash transfers using India's digital payment infrastructure like UPI, which is apparently pretty sophisticated now.\n\nBut real talk - I'm a backend dev in Austin making good money. I don't understand the ground realities of poverty in India well enough to have a confident take. This feels like something that needs input from economists and people actually living there, not tech bros theorizing from 8,000 miles away.",
      "Honestly, UBI in India feels like a massive systems design problem that's way outside my expertise, but I'll give you my tech worker take.\n\nFrom a pure engineering perspective, the implementation challenges seem insane. You're talking about distributing payments to 1.4 billion people, many without bank accounts or reliable internet. The infrastructure alone would be a nightmare - though India's done surprisingly well with Aadhaar and UPI, so maybe it's more feasible than I'd think.\n\nThe AI automation angle is interesting but probably overhyped for India's timeline. Most job displacement there isn't happening from AI - it's still industrialization, outsourcing dynamics, and agricultural shifts. We're automating coding tasks here, but India's economy is way more diverse than that.\n\nMy bigger concern: wouldn't that money be better spent on infrastructure, education, and healthcare first? UBI feels like a band-aid when the underlying systems need building. But again, I'm a backend engineer in Austin, not an economist studying developing nations.\n\nThe whole thing makes me realize how US-centric my perspective is. Most UBI discussions I see are about cushioning tech workers when AGI arrives, not addressing poverty in different economic contexts entirely."

      "Look, I don't know much about India specifically - I haul freight across the US, not overseas. But if you're asking what I think about the government just handing everyone money every month, I got some thoughts.\n\nFirst off, somebody's gotta pay for that, and it ain't gonna be the folks receiving it. That means higher taxes on people who are working. I already pay enough in taxes between federal, state, fuel taxes, and all the rest.\n\nSecond, I've seen what happens when people get comfortable not working. We got a driver shortage right now partly because folks would rather sit home. If you pay people to do nothing, a lot of 'em will take that deal.\n\nNow, I get it - if robots and AI really do take over jobs someday, maybe something's gotta give. But in a place like India with over a billion people? Where's that money coming from? \n\nI think it's one of those ideas that sounds good on paper but falls apart when you actually try to do it in the real world. Better to focus on jobs and training, not handouts.",
      "Look, I don't know much about India specifically - I haul loads across the US, not over there. But from what I understand, they've got a hell of a lot more people than we do, and a lot of folks living on next to nothing.\n\nHere's what I know: When the government starts handing out checks, somebody's gotta pay for it. And usually that's working people like me. I've been busting my ass for 22 years, 3 weeks a month on the road, away from my family. If I can make 70 grand doing that, why should I be paying taxes so someone else can sit at home?\n\nNow, I get it - if those self-driving trucks ever actually happen, a lot of us are gonna be hurting. But the answer isn't free money. It's finding new work, retraining, something. My granddaddy didn't take handouts during the Depression, and I was raised the same way.\n\nMaybe it's different in India - I hear their economy's growing fast. But free money? That's not how you build a strong country. You build it by people working hard and taking care of their own.",
      "Look, I don't know much about India specifically - that's halfway around the world from my routes. But if you're asking what I think about the government just giving people money for nothing, I got strong feelings about that.\n\nI've worked my ass off for 22 years. Been away from my family, dealt with bad weather, crazy drivers, loading dock BS at 2 AM. Nobody handed me nothing. I earned every dollar.\n\nNow, I get it - if robots or AI or whatever really do take jobs, something's gotta give. But just cutting checks? That's gonna make people lazy and kill their pride. Work gives you purpose, you know? My dad always said idle hands are the devil's workshop.\n\nWhat happens when half the country's sitting around collecting checks while the other half works to pay for it? That math don't add up, and it ain't fair.\n\nIf India's got poverty problems, seems like they need more jobs and opportunities, not handouts. Teach a man to fish and all that. But again, I'm just a truck driver from Tennessee - what do I know about India?"
