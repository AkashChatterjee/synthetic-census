# AI Job Impact: Panel Study Analysis

## Executive Summary

The panel reveals a striking pattern of **pragmatic adaptation over panic**, with all five personas rejecting simplistic replacement narratives while acknowledging significant workflow changes. Consistency across responses is uniformly high, suggesting these views represent settled convictions rather than ambivalence. A clear fault line emerges between knowledge workers who see AI as productivity enhancement (teachers, radiologists, software engineers) and operational workers (retail managers, truck drivers) who fear economic pressure disguised as automation. The most consistent theme: AI struggles with context, judgment, and the messy complexity of real-world work.

## Intra-Persona Consistency Analysis

| Persona | Consistency | Interpretation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| High School Teacher | High | Strong conviction about irreplaceable human elements (connection, critical thinking) balanced with pragmatic acceptance of workflow changes. The specific concerns (class sizes, assessment redesign) indicate deep professional reflection. |
| Radiologist | High | Confident dismissal of replacement narrative, grounded in technical understanding of AI's current limitations. The specificity of examples (PE with incidental findings, artifact-laden images) suggests experiential certainty. |
| Retail Manager | High | Clear-eyed about automation trends while firmly convinced of human necessity for judgment calls and customer service. The mixed-bag framing appears to be genuine nuance, not uncertainty. |
| Software Engineer | High | Settled view that coding becomes commoditized while architectural/strategic work increases in value. Concern about junior pipeline indicates systemic thinking beyond personal impact. |
| Truck Driver | High | Deeply skeptical of automation timeline based on repeated false predictions. Detailed enumeration of non-driving tasks suggests conviction rooted in tacit knowledge outsiders miss. |

**Key Observation**: Single samples per persona limit our ability to detect ambivalence, but the internal coherence and specificity of each response suggests these represent stable viewpoints rather than momentary reactions.

## Cross-Persona Analysis

### Points of Consensus

**Universal Agreement (5/5 personas):**
- **AI handles routine/structured tasks; humans handle complexity and judgment** - Every persona distinguishes between automatable components and irreducibly human elements of their work
- **The "replacement" narrative is oversimplified** - All reject binary thinking, even those most concerned about job loss
- **Workflow transformation is already underway** - No one sees this as hypothetical; all describe current changes
- **Economic pressure matters more than technical capability** - Four of five explicitly worry about employers using AI to justify cost-cutting, wage suppression, or understaffing

**Strong Agreement (4/5 personas):**
- **Context and integration are human domains** - Teacher (why literature matters), Radiologist (clinical context), Retail Manager (judgment calls), Software Engineer (understanding business problems) all emphasize synthesis over execution

### Key Fault Lines

**Camp 1: "AI as Productivity Tool" (Teacher, Radiologist, Software Engineer)**
- View AI as augmentation that shifts their work toward higher-value activities
- Confident in job security while acknowledging role evolution
- Primary concern: keeping pace with change, not unemployment
- Shared characteristic: Work involves significant judgment, expertise, and credentialing

**Camp 2: "AI as Economic Threat" (Retail Manager, Truck Driver)**
- View AI as potential justification for workforce reduction or wage suppression
- Less confident about job security, especially for newer workers
- Primary concern: corporate cost-cutting disguised as innovation
- Shared characteristic: Work is more vulnerable to deskilling or labor arbitrage

**The Software Engineer occupies interesting middle ground**: personally secure but concerned about systemic effects (junior pipeline), suggesting awareness of broader labor market dynamics.

### Unexpected Findings

1. **The Radiologist's confidence is striking** - Despite years of "radiologists will be replaced" headlines, this persona shows the *least* anxiety of any respondent, grounded in technical realism about AI limitations.

2. **The Teacher is more optimistic than expected** - While worried about administrative decisions, shows genuine excitement about focusing on higher-order teaching, contrasting with media narratives of teacher technophobia.

3. **The Truck Driver's skepticism is highly specific** - Rather than general Luddism, demonstrates sophisticated understanding of what automation can and cannot handle, based on pattern recognition from failed predictions.

4. **Unanimous concern about economic exploitation** - Even the most secure professionals worry about AI being used to justify worse working conditions, suggesting this transcends individual job security.

5. **No one mentions upskilling/reskilling** - Despite this being a dominant policy narrative, not a single persona frames their adaptation in these terms, suggesting disconnect between expert discourse and worker experience.

## Predicted Population Sentiment

| Position | Estimated % | Key Demographics |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| "Cautiously Adapting" - Job will change significantly but remain | 40-50% | Credentialed professionals, skilled trades requiring judgment, workers with specialized tacit knowledge |
| "Economically Threatened" - Job may survive but wages/conditions will deteriorate | 25-35% | Routine cognitive work, operational roles, workers in cost-sensitive industries, newer entrants |
| "Confidently Secure" - AI enhances rather than threatens role | 15-20% | High-expertise roles with regulatory/liability requirements, work requiring human relationships, senior positions |
| "Facing Displacement" - Job likely to be eliminated or fundamentally deskilled | 10-15% | Highly routine work, roles already partially automated, industries with strong cost pressure |

**Note**: These estimates assume the panel reasonably represents employed adults in AI-exposed sectors. Missing perspectives (gig workers, creative professionals, healthcare providers, manual laborers in non-driving roles) would likely shift distributions.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Confidence Level**: Medium

- **Limiting Factors**: 
  - Single sample per persona prevents ambivalence detection
  - Only five personas from limited occupational range
  - Missing perspectives: healthcare workers (beyond radiologists), creative professionals, gig economy workers, manual laborers, unemployed/displaced workers, executives/management, public sector workers
  - No demographic variation within occupations (age, geography, company size all matter)
  - Personas may over-represent articulate, reflective workers
  - No representation of workers already displaced by automation

- **Recommendations for Strengthened Analysis**:
  - Add: Nurse/healthcare provider, graphic designer/creative, warehouse worker, customer service representative, accountant/financial analyst, journalist, paralegal
  - Include workers at different career stages (early, mid, late)
  - Sample workers from different company sizes and sectors (startup vs. enterprise, public vs. private)
  - Include at least one persona who has already experienced job displacement
  - Increase samples per persona to 3-5 to detect ambivalence patterns
  - Add explicit demographic variables (age, education, geography, economic security)

## Synthesized Article

### **Workers See AI Reshaping Jobs, Not Eliminating Them—But Fear Cost-Cutting by Another Name**

Five years into the generative AI revolution, American workers are developing a nuanced view of automation that defies the binary narratives dominating public discourse. Rather than panic about robot replacements or dismiss concerns entirely, workers across industries describe a more complex reality: their jobs are transforming rapidly, but the greatest threat may not be the technology itself.

Interviews with workers from education, healthcare, retail, technology, and transportation reveal a striking consensus: AI excels at routine tasks but struggles with the messy, context-dependent reality of actual work. A radiologist notes that while AI can flag obvious findings, it cannot integrate clinical context or handle the judgment calls that define medical practice. A high school teacher expects AI tutors to handle rote explanation, freeing her to focus on critical thinking and human connection. A truck driver rattles off a dozen non-driving tasks—navigating loading docks, handling paperwork, rerouting around emergencies—that automation cannot touch.

This isn't technophobia. These workers are already using AI tools and adapting their workflows. The software engineer spends 30% less time on boilerplate code; the radiologist uses automated measurements daily. They're pragmatic about efficiency gains and even optimistic about focusing on higher-value work.

But beneath this adaptation lies a deeper anxiety: that employers will use AI as justification for cost-cutting regardless of technical capability. The retail manager worries corporate will slash floor staff "thinking AI can handle everything," even though customers still need human help. The truck driver fears automation on easy interstate routes will flood his segment with displaced drivers, suppressing wages. Even the teacher, excited about pedagogical possibilities, dreads administrators using AI to increase class sizes.

This concern transcends individual job security. The software engineer, personally confident, worries about the "junior pipeline drying up" if new developers never get the repetitive practice that builds expertise. The truck driver focuses less on his own prospects—he has twenty years of experience and paid-off equipment—than on younger drivers entering a shrinking field.

The workers most confident about their futures share a common trait: their roles involve high-stakes judgment protected by regulation or liability. The radiologist signs reports and bears legal responsibility AI cannot assume. The teacher must notice when students struggle with more than academics. These human elements create what one worker called "irreducible complexity."

Meanwhile, workers in cost-sensitive industries express a different calculation. They see automation's technical limitations clearly but understand that corporate decisions aren't always driven by what works best. The retail manager knows self-checkout frustrates customers and creates more work when it fails, but also knows executives see it as a line item reduction.

Notably absent from these conversations: the policy world's favorite solution of "reskilling" and "upskilling." Not one worker framed their adaptation in these terms, suggesting a disconnect between expert prescriptions and lived experience. These workers aren't planning career pivots; they're navigating daily evolution in roles they've spent years mastering.

What emerges is a portrait of American workers as neither Luddites nor naive optimists, but as keen observers of both technological capability and economic power. They're adapting to AI not because they fear obsolescence, but because they understand their jobs have always evolved. What they fear is that efficiency gains will flow entirely to shareholders while automation becomes an excuse for deteriorating pay and conditions—technology as cover for age-old labor arbitrage.

The question, then, may not be whether AI can do these jobs, but whether we'll allow it to reshape them in ways that benefit workers or merely extract value from their adaptation.

# Appendix B: Raw Responses

Each persona was queried independently via isolated API calls. Responses are presented in order of collection.

## High School Teacher

### Sample 1

Honestly? I'm both hopeful and worried. 

I think I'll still be here—kids need human connection, someone to challenge them, to notice when they're struggling with more than just Shakespeare. But the job itself? It's already changing fast.

In five years, I imagine I'll be less of a lecturer and more of a... guide? Facilitator? Students will have AI tutors that can explain iambic pentameter perfectly at 2am. My role will be teaching them *why* literature matters, how to think critically about what AI tells them, how to develop their own voice instead of just prompting their way through assignments.

The grading might actually get easier—AI can help flag plagiarism and even provide first-pass feedback. But I'll need to design completely different assessments. More Socratic seminars, in-class writing, projects that require genuine creativity and human judgment.

What worries me? The district seeing AI as a way to increase class sizes or cut positions. And honestly, keeping up with this pace of change on a teacher's salary and schedule is exhausting. We need serious professional development, not just a one-hour workshop.

I'm adapting, but I didn't sign up to reinvent my entire curriculum every two years.

---

## Radiologist

### Sample 1

Honestly? Probably not that different from today, despite what the headlines say.

We've been using AI for years—CAD systems for mammography, automated bone age assessments, lung nodule detection. The new stuff is incrementally better, not revolutionary. In 5 years, I expect more sophisticated triage algorithms, better automated measurements, maybe some preliminary draft reports for straightforward cases.

But here's what won't change: I'm still the one integrating clinical context, comparing to priors, catching the subtle findings, talking to clinicians about complex cases, and signing my name to the interpretation. The liability is mine. When there's a PE on CTA and an incidental renal mass, AI might flag both, but I'm deciding what matters for *this* patient right now.

What will change is efficiency. I might read 20% more studies. The boring, repetitive stuff gets faster. That's good—I'd rather spend time on the interesting cases and teaching residents.

The existential threat narrative is exhausting. Show me an AI that can handle a 2am stroke protocol with a confused patient, artifact-laden images, and a neurologist calling for a real-time read. I'll wait.

---

## Retail Manager

### Sample 1

Honestly? I think it'll be a mixed bag. We're already seeing more self-checkout and automated inventory systems, so that trend's definitely continuing. I could see AI helping with scheduling—God knows our current system is terrible at predicting when we'll actually be busy.

The warehouse side will probably get more automated. We've already got some smart systems tracking stock, but I bet in 5 years there'll be robots doing more of the heavy lifting and restocking. That's actually fine by me—less back injuries for my team.

What worries me is corporate will probably push even harder to cut floor staff, thinking AI can handle everything. But like... customers still need actual humans when they can't find something or have a problem. Self-checkout is great until it's not, you know? Then they need ME to fix it.

I'm hoping to be a store manager by then, and honestly, I think the management side stays pretty human. You can't automate dealing with difficult customers, coaching employees, or making judgment calls when weird situations pop up—which is literally every day in retail.

The real question is whether they'll use AI as an excuse to keep wages low. That's my biggest concern.

---

## Software Engineer

### Sample 1

Honestly? I think the day-to-day coding part gets way faster but also way less of my actual job. I'm already spending maybe 30% less time on boilerplate and routine CRUD stuff thanks to Copilot and Cursor. That trend accelerates.

What I think happens: The "translate requirements into working code" part becomes almost trivial for standard stuff. My value shifts hard toward architecture decisions, understanding business context, debugging weird edge cases, and honestly just knowing what to build and why. The AI can't sit in planning meetings and figure out that the PM's requirements are actually solving the wrong problem.

I'm less worried about being replaced and more worried about the junior pipeline drying up. How do new devs get good if they skip the reps? That could actually make experienced devs more valuable short-term, but it's a weird spot.

Biggest change: I think "prompt engineering" becomes as important as knowing algorithms. And I'll probably be managing/reviewing AI-generated code more than writing from scratch. 

Still not starting that company though—too much golden handcuffs with this TC and the market uncertainty.

---

## Truck Driver

### Sample 1

Look, I've been hearing about robots taking my job since 2015, maybe earlier. Every year it's "five more years" and here I am, still driving.

Here's what people don't get: I don't just drive. I'm dealing with loading docks where the forklift guy doesn't speak English, I'm checking cargo securement in ice storms, I'm backing into tight spaces that weren't designed for a 53-footer, I'm handling paperwork at weigh stations, dealing with breakdowns in the middle of nowhere. Last month I had to reroute around a wildfire using back roads that aren't on any GPS.

Could AI drive on the interstate? Maybe, in perfect weather. But that's like 30% of what I actually do.

What I *do* think will happen is more automation on the easy routes—like those big distribution runs on I-40 between major hubs. That might push more drivers like me into the harder regional work, which means more competition for those jobs and probably lower pay.

The guys I worry about are the younger drivers just starting out. They might not get those 20 years I've had to build up savings and pay off equipment. That's the real problem nobody's talking about.
