      "Honestly, I'm pretty selective about PM content on LinkedIn because most of it feels like generic \"10 tips to prioritize your roadmap\" fluff that consultants like me could write in our sleep.\n\nWhat I *actually* want to read:\n\n**Real case studies with numbers** - How did a PM at Swiggy or Razorpay actually increase retention by X%? What frameworks did they use? What failed first? I can smell bullshit from a mile away, so give me the messy truth.\n\n**Product strategy for Indian market context** - Not just Silicon Valley playbooks. How do you build for Tier 2/3 cities? What does product-market fit look like when your users have 2G connectivity?\n\n**Career transition stories** - Consulting to PM is on my radar for better work-life balance. I want honest takes on comp changes, skill gaps, interview prep, and whether the grass is actually greener.\n\n**AI/ML integration in products** - Practical applications, not hype. How are Indian companies actually using AI beyond chatbots?\n\nSkip the motivational quotes and \"hustle culture\" posts. I get enough of that internally. Give me actionable insights I can apply or at least debate intelligently in my next client meeting.",
      "Honestly, I'm selective about PM content because most of it is either too theoretical or just rehashing basic frameworks. What actually catches my attention:\n\n**Case studies with real metrics** - How PMs at companies like Zerodha, CRED, or Razorpay made specific decisions and what the business impact was. I want to see the trade-offs, not just the wins.\n\n**Product strategy for B2B SaaS** - Since many of my clients are in this space, posts about PLG motions, enterprise sales alignment, or building for Indian vs. global markets are relevant. Lenny's Newsletter style but India-focused.\n\n**Career pivots from consulting to PM** - I'm genuinely curious about this transition. What skills translate? What's overrated? How's the comp and work-life balance actually different?\n\n**AI/ML product development** - Not the hype stuff, but practical applications. How are PMs working with data scientists? What's the discovery process like?\n\nI scroll past generic \"10 frameworks every PM should know\" posts. If it's not backed by real experience or data, or doesn't help me understand whether PM is a viable next move for me, I'm not engaging.",
      "I'd be interested in posts that help me understand the PM function better since I'm considering it as a potential exit option from consulting. Specifically:\n\n**Strategic frameworks** - How PMs think about product-market fit, prioritization matrices like RICE or ICE, and 0-to-1 vs scaling decisions. I can relate these to my consulting frameworks.\n\n**Transition stories** - Real accounts from consultants who moved to PM roles, especially at startups or mid-stage companies. What skills translated well? What was surprisingly different?\n\n**Compensation benchmarks** - Honest discussions about PM salary bands, ESOPs, and total comp at different company stages. I need to know if the financial trade-off makes sense.\n\n**Day-in-the-life content** - Actual work routines, meeting structures, stakeholder management. I want to assess if the work-life balance is genuinely better than consulting.\n\n**Technical depth required** - How much do I need to upskill? Can my engineering background compensate for lack of coding practice?\n\nI skip the motivational fluff and \"hustle culture\" posts. Give me actionable insights, frameworks, and honest trade-offs.

Like:\n\n- How are other wholesale businesses using technology without losing the personal touch? I need to understand WhatsApp Business, these payment apps, inventory systems - but explained simply, not with all that technical jargon.\n\n- Stories about traditional businesses adapting to online competition. How do I compete with these Amazon-Flipkart types while keeping my loyal customers?\n\n- Tips on managing costs and improving margins. Rent is killing us in Dadar, labor costs are up, and buyers want lower prices.\n\nI don't care much about fancy frameworks or Silicon Valley startup stories - that's a different world. I want real examples from people in manufacturing, trading, wholesale. Show me what worked for someone like me.\n\nAnd please, write in simple English! Half these posts use words I need to Google. I'm running a business, not writing a thesis."
