# Research Analysis: LinkedIn Product Management Content Preferences

## Executive Summary

The panel reveals a striking consensus across all demographics: **authenticity and practical utility trump generic frameworks and motivational content**. High-earning professionals (Corporate, Software Engineer, Startup Founder) demonstrate strong conviction with consistent demands for metrics-driven case studies, salary transparency, and India-specific insights. Lower-income personas (Delivery Worker, Traditional Business Owner) show consistent disengagement from LinkedIn entirely, viewing it as irrelevant to their daily realities. The middle-tier personas (Retail Shop Owner) bridge these worlds, seeking simplified, actionable advice. The most significant finding: even digitally-native professionals are fatigued by performative LinkedIn culture, creating opportunity for radically honest, tactical content.

## Intra-Persona Consistency Analysis

| Persona | Consistency | Interpretation |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Corporate Professional | **High** | Strong conviction about wanting case studies with real metrics, career transition insights, and India-specific content. Consistent disdain for "fluff" and motivational posts across all three samples. |
| Delivery Worker | **Very High** | Unanimous non-engagement with LinkedIn. All three responses express unfamiliarity with the platform and product management concepts. Consistent focus on practical, immediate income-generating activities. |
| Retail Shop Owner | **High** | Consistent desire for practical, jargon-free advice applicable to small businesses. All samples emphasize competition with e-commerce and need for simple digital solutions. |
| Software Engineer | **Very High** | Remarkable consistency in frustration with generic content. All three samples specifically request salary transparency, honest transition stories, and India-specific technical PM content. |
| Startup Founder | **High** | Consistent focus on tactical, metrics-driven content with real numbers. All samples explicitly reject generic frameworks and request B2B SaaS-specific insights. |
| Traditional Business Owner | **High** | Consistent limited engagement with LinkedIn. All samples express preference for practical examples from similar traditional businesses, with skepticism toward tech-centric content. |

**Key Observation**: The high consistency across all personas suggests these are deeply held preferences rather than superficial opinions. The Delivery Worker and Software Engineer personas show particularly strong conviction.

## Cross-Persona Analysis

### Points of Consensus

**Universal rejection of generic, motivational content** (5/6 personas explicitly stated):
- Corporate Professional: "Skip the motivational quotes"
- Software Engineer: "I'm tired of the generic '10 lessons from my PM journey' posts"
- Startup Founder: "I skip anything that feels like generic thought leadership"
- Retail Shop Owner: "Long, boring corporate posts? Skip kar deti hoon"
- Traditional Business Owner: "I don't want motivational quotes with someone's photo"

**Demand for practical, actionable insights** (6/6 personas):
Every persona, including the disengaged Delivery Worker, expressed preference for content directly applicable to their work context.

**Desire for real numbers and transparency** (4/6 personas):
Corporate Professional, Software Engineer, and Startup Founder explicitly requested metrics, salary data, and quantified outcomes.

### Key Fault Lines

**Digital Divide - Platform Relevance**:
- **Engaged Camp**: Corporate Professional, Software Engineer, Startup Founder actively use LinkedIn and seek sophisticated content
- **Disengaged Camp**: Delivery Worker, Traditional Business Owner view LinkedIn as irrelevant or intimidating
- **Bridge Position**: Retail Shop Owner uses LinkedIn minimally but sees potential value

**Content Sophistication Expectations**:
- **High Complexity**: Corporate Professional, Software Engineer, Startup Founder want technical depth, frameworks, and strategic insights
- **Simplified Approach**: Retail Shop Owner, Traditional Business Owner explicitly request "simple language," "no jargon"
- **Non-Participant**: Delivery Worker doesn't engage with product management concepts at all

**Geographic/Market Context**:
- **India-Specific Focus**: Corporate Professional, Software Engineer, Retail Shop Owner all explicitly mentioned tier-2/3 cities, Indian market challenges
- **Universal Business Principles**: Startup Founder and Traditional Business Owner less focused on geographic specificity

### Unexpected Findings

1. **Class-Based LinkedIn Perception**: The Delivery Worker's responses reveal LinkedIn is perceived as exclusively for "suit-boot wale log" (suit-wearing people), suggesting the platform has a significant class-barrier problem in India that product managers may not recognize.

2. **Anti-Performativity Consensus**: Even high-status professionals (Corporate, Startup Founder) explicitly reject LinkedIn's culture of self-promotion, suggesting the platform's engagement mechanisms may be misaligned with user preferences.

3. **Career Transition Obsession**: The Corporate Professional's consistent interest in consulting-to-PM transitions across all three samples suggests this is a major use case for PM content that may be underserved.

4. **Women Entrepreneurs Seeking Role Models**: The Retail Shop Owner specifically mentioned wanting "success stories of women entrepreneurs," a demographic-specific need not mentioned by other personas.

## Predicted Population Sentiment

| Position | Estimated % | Key Demographics |
|----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Active seekers of sophisticated PM content** | 15-20% | Urban professionals in tech, consulting, startups; typically college-educated, English-fluent, earning ₹10L+ annually |
| **Occasional consumers seeking practical business advice** | 10-15% | Small business owners, retail entrepreneurs; mixed educational backgrounds, seeking simplified content applicable to traditional businesses |
| **Non-engaged/LinkedIn non-users** | 60-70% | Blue-collar workers, gig economy participants, traditional business owners in tier-2/3 cities; view LinkedIn as irrelevant or inaccessible |
| **Passive presence (account but minimal engagement)** | 5-10% | Various demographics who maintain profiles for professional credibility but don't actively consume content |

**Critical Note**: These estimates reflect India's tier-1 city population. The "non-engaged" percentage would likely increase to 85%+ in a nationally representative sample.

## Confidence Assessment

- **Confidence Level**: **Medium-High**

- **Limiting Factors**: 
  - Missing perspectives: Mid-level managers, HR professionals, designers, data analysts, students/recent graduates
  - Gender representation: Only 1 clearly female persona (Retail Shop Owner)
  - Age diversity: No explicit senior executives (50+) or Gen-Z professionals
  - Geographic limitation: "Tier 1 City" excludes tier-2/3 perspectives
  - Industry gaps: No healthcare, education, government, or manufacturing sector professionals

- **Recommendations for Strengthening Analysis**:
  1. Add "Product Manager" persona to understand what current PMs want to read
  2. Include "MBA Student/Recent Graduate" to capture aspirational perspectives
  3. Add "Mid-Level Manager (Non-Tech)" to understand cross-functional stakeholder views
  4. Include "Freelancer/Consultant" to capture gig economy professional perspectives
  5. Add explicit age and gender diversity markers to existing personas

## Synthesized Article

### **The LinkedIn Product Management Content Crisis: Why Even Professionals Are Tuning Out**

LinkedIn's product management content ecosystem faces a credibility crisis, according to insights from diverse urban professionals. While the platform has become the de facto hub for PM discourse, a growing chorus of voices—from software engineers to startup founders—expresses deep frustration with what they perceive as performative, generic content that prioritizes engagement over utility.

"Most of it feels like generic '10 tips to prioritize your roadmap' fluff," explains a management consultant considering a transition to product management. This sentiment echoes across the professional spectrum, with a startup founder noting, "I'm drowning in generic PM content on LinkedIn," and a software engineer lamenting the "humble-brag" culture that dominates the feed.

The disconnect reveals a fundamental tension: while LinkedIn's algorithm rewards inspirational narratives and polished success stories, professionals increasingly crave tactical, metrics-driven insights they can immediately apply. A startup founder articulates the gap: "I need to see the actual data, what you'd do differently," while a software engineer requests "actual comp discussions for PM roles at different levels" rather than vague career advice.

Particularly striking is the demand for India-specific content. Multiple professionals expressed fatigue with Silicon Valley-centric advice that ignores local market realities. "What about building for tier-2 cities, dealing with low bandwidth, payment failures, regional language support?" asks one engineer. A consultant similarly seeks "product strategy for Indian market context—not just Silicon Valley playbooks."

The platform's relevance problem extends beyond content quality to fundamental accessibility. For working-class professionals like delivery workers, LinkedIn remains entirely foreign territory. "LinkedIn? That's for office people who wear suits," one delivery worker explains, highlighting a class divide that product managers—focused on their own professional bubble—may not recognize. Even small business owners, who could benefit from product thinking, find the platform intimidating: "Most posts use words I need to Google. I'm running a business, not writing a thesis."

The middle ground is occupied by entrepreneurs like retail shop owners who see potential value but struggle with execution. They seek "practical advice in simple language, not corporate jargon," and "success stories of women entrepreneurs" rather than tech unicorn narratives. This demographic wants to understand how product management principles apply to their 60-year-old textile business or boutique competing with Myntra.

What unites these diverse perspectives is a hunger for authenticity. Professionals want "honest failure stories—not the humble-brag kind," "real war stories" about product decisions that failed, and "the messy truth, not the polished retrospective." They're requesting salary transparency, admission of mistakes, and vulnerability—precisely what LinkedIn's professional posturing culture discourages.

The opportunity for content creators is clear: radical honesty, quantified outcomes, India-specific insights, and tactical frameworks with real implementation examples. The audience exists and is engaged, but they're increasingly selective, scrolling past motivational quotes and framework diagrams in search of substance. As one founder succinctly puts it: "Need actionable > inspirational."

For LinkedIn and the PM content ecosystem, the challenge is whether the platform's engagement mechanics can evolve to reward the depth and authenticity that professionals actually want, or whether this audience will migrate to communities that better serve their needs.

# Appendix B: Raw Responses

Each persona was queried independently via isolated API calls. Responses are presented in order of collection.

## Corporate Professional

### Sample 1

Honestly, I'm pretty selective about PM content on LinkedIn because most of it feels like generic "10 tips to prioritize your roadmap" fluff that consultants like me could write in our sleep.

What I *actually* want to read:

**Real case studies with numbers** - How did a PM at Swiggy or Razorpay actually increase retention by X%? What frameworks did they use? What failed first? I can smell bullshit from a mile away, so give me the messy truth.

**Product strategy for Indian market context** - Not just Silicon Valley playbooks. How do you build for Tier 2/3 cities? What does product-market fit look like when your users have 2G connectivity?

**Career transition stories** - Consulting to PM is on my radar for better work-life balance. I want honest takes on comp changes, skill gaps, interview prep, and whether the grass is actually greener.

**AI/ML integration in products** - Practical applications, not hype. How are Indian companies actually using AI beyond chatbots?

Skip the motivational quotes and "hustle culture" posts. I get enough of that internally. Give me actionable insights I can apply or at least debate intelligently in my next client meeting.

### Sample 2

Honestly, I'm selective about PM content because most of it is either too theoretical or just rehashing basic frameworks. What actually catches my attention:

**Case studies with real metrics** - How PMs at companies like Zerodha, CRED, or Razorpay made specific decisions and what the business impact was. I want to see the trade-offs, not just the wins.

**Product strategy for B2B SaaS** - Since many of my clients are in this space, posts about PLG motions, enterprise sales alignment, or building for Indian vs. global markets are relevant. Lenny's Newsletter style but India-focused.

**Career pivots from consulting to PM** - I'm genuinely curious about this transition. What skills translate? What's overrated? How's the comp and work-life balance actually different?

**AI/ML product development** - Not the hype stuff, but practical applications. How are PMs working with data scientists? What's the discovery process like?

I scroll past generic "10 frameworks every PM should know" posts. If it's not backed by real experience or data, or doesn't help me understand whether PM is a viable next move for me, I'm not engaging.

### Sample 3

I'd be interested in posts that help me understand the PM function better since I'm considering it as a potential exit option from consulting. Specifically:

**Strategic frameworks** - How PMs think about product-market fit, prioritization matrices like RICE or ICE, and 0-to-1 vs scaling decisions. I can relate these to my consulting frameworks.

**Transition stories** - Real accounts from consultants who moved to PM roles, especially at startups or mid-stage companies. What skills translated well? What was surprisingly different?

**Compensation benchmarks** - Honest discussions about PM salary bands, ESOPs, and total comp at different company stages. I need to know if the financial trade-off makes sense.

**Day-in-the-life content** - Actual work routines, meeting structures, stakeholder management. I want to assess if the work-life balance is genuinely better than consulting.

**Technical depth required** - How much do I need to upskill? Can my engineering background compensate for lack of coding practice?

I skip the motivational fluff and "hustle culture" posts. Give me actionable insights, frameworks, and honest trade-offs. I'm evaluating this as a career move, not looking for inspiration.

## Delivery Worker

### Sample 1

Bhai, LinkedIn? Maine kabhi use nahi kiya yaar. Woh toh office waale log chalate hain na - jo suit-boot pehen ke kaam karte hain. Mujhe toh pata bhi nahi "product management" kya hota hai exactly.

Mere phone mein toh bas WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube hai. Aur haan, delivery apps - Swiggy, Zomato, Amazon. LinkedIn install karne ki zaroorat hi nahi padi kabhi.

Agar aap puch rahe ho ki main kya padhna chahunga... toh honestly, mujhe aise posts chahiye jo mere kaam ke ho. Jaise:

- Bike ki maintenance ke tips
- Petrol bachane ke tareeke
- Traffic rules aur fines se kaise bacha jaye
- Peak hours mein zyada orders kaise mile
- Customer se achhe ratings kaise le
- Koi side business ideas jo kam paise mein shuru ho sake

Yeh LinkedIn pe hota hai kya? Mujhe nahi lagta. Wahan pe toh corporate log apni English mein kuch bhi likhte rehte hain. Mere kaam ka kuch nahi hota.

Aap LinkedIn pe kaam karte ho kya? Achha paisa milta hai usme?

### Sample 2

Bhai, LinkedIn? Main toh bas WhatsApp aur Instagram chalata hoon. LinkedIn ka account hai but kabhi khola nahi, bas job ke liye banaya tha. Wahan pe sab English mein corporate baatein hoti hain na?

Agar product management ki baat kar rahe ho, toh mujhe samajh nahi aata yeh kya hota hai. Haan, agar koi post ho jo delivery apps ke baare mein ho - jaise Swiggy ya Zomato apne app mein kya naya feature laa rahe hain, delivery partners ke liye kya benefits hain, ya incentive scheme kaise kaam karti hai - toh woh dekhna pasand karunga.

Ya phir agar koi simple Hindi mein bataye ki apps kaise bante hain, delivery system kaise improve hota hai, ya humara payment calculation kaise hota hai - yeh useful hoga. Lekin sach kahoon, main LinkedIn pe time waste nahi karta. Mera focus deliveries pe rehta hai. Agar koi important information hai toh WhatsApp group mein share kar do, wahan dekh lunga.

Waise bhi, LinkedIn pe toh suit-boot wale log apni tareef khud karte rehte hain. Humara kaam ground pe hai, LinkedIn pe nahi.

### Sample 3

भाई साहब, सच बताऊं तो LinkedIn मैं कभी-कभार ही खोलता हूं, वो भी गलती से जब कोई link आ जाता है WhatsApp पर। Product management का मुझे ज्यादा पता नहीं, लेकिन अगर कुछ पढ़ना हो तो ऐसी चीज़ें अच्छी लगेंगी:

- **Delivery apps कैसे बेहतर बना सकते हैं** - जैसे navigation सही हो, customer का address ठीक से mile, payment instant aaye, और incentive का calculation सीधा-सीधा हो

- **Gig workers के लिए features** - जैसे bike maintenance reminder, health insurance, accident cover, petrol price tracker

- **App में क्या problem है और कैसे solve करेंगे** - क्योंकि हम रोज़ इन apps में glitches देखते हैं

लेकिन honestly, LinkedIn पर time waste करने से अच्छा है एक delivery ज्यादा कर लूं। ₹50 और मिल जाएंगे। Product management वाले posts तो उन लोगों के लिए हैं जो office में AC में बैठकर काम करते हैं। हमारे लिए practical चीज़ें चाहिए, theory नहीं।

## Retail Shop Owner

### Sample 1

Honestly, I don't spend much time on LinkedIn - I'm more on Instagram and Facebook for my business. But when I do scroll through, I notice posts that catch my eye are the ones that actually solve my problems.

I'd want to read about:

**Real solutions for small businesses** - like how to compete with Myntra and Amazon. These big apps are eating into my sales, and I need to understand what they're doing differently.

**Customer behavior insights** - why do young girls prefer online shopping? What makes them visit physical stores? I need to know this to keep my boutique relevant.

**Simple tech tools** - posts about easy-to-use apps for inventory management, digital payments, or customer loyalty programs. Nothing too technical, please - something I can actually implement myself.

**Success stories of women entrepreneurs** - especially those who've managed to create their own brand or online presence. Not the big corporate stories, but relatable ones.

Basically, I want practical advice in simple language, not corporate jargon. Show me how product thinking can help my boutique survive and grow. Case studies with real numbers and results would be very helpful!

### Sample 2

देखिए, मैं LinkedIn पर ज्यादा active तो नहीं हूँ, लेकिन जब scroll करती हूँ तो कुछ चीज़ें मेरा ध्यान खींचती हैं।

Mujhe aise posts पसंद आते हैं जो बताएं कि कैसे छोटे businesses digital हो सकते हैं - simple language में, bina technical jargon के। Like how to use Instagram Shopping properly, या WhatsApp Business से orders कैसे manage करें। 

Customer psychology wale posts bhi interesting लगते हैं - why people buy, what makes them choose one shop over another, especially online vs offline decisions. Yeh samajhna zaroori hai aajkal.

Inventory management, pricing strategies - agar koi real examples ke saath practical tips de, not just theory, toh bahut helpful hota hai. Mujhe woh posts acche lagte hain jo retail owners ki real problems address karें.

Aur honestly, success stories of small business owners, especially women, jo digitally grow kiye apne business ko - woh inspiring bhi hain aur seekhne ko bhi milta hai. But long, boring corporate posts? Skip kar deti hूँ. Mujhe actionable advice chahiye jo main apni shop में implement kar sakूँ.

### Sample 3

*Laughs* Dekho, LinkedIn par toh bahut kuch aata hai, but honestly, most product management posts mere kaam ke nahi lagte. Too technical, too corporate-world focused.

Lekin agar koi aise posts dale toh main zaroor padhungi:

**"How small businesses can use basic product thinking"** - Like how to decide what inventory to stock based on customer feedback, not just gut feeling. I do this naturally, but structured approach would help.

**"Understanding what Gen-Z customers actually want"** - My teenagers and their friends are so different! If someone explains their shopping behavior in simple terms, that's gold for me.

**"Digital presence for small retailers"** - Not complicated tech stuff, but practical tips on Instagram selling, WhatsApp Business, etc. Competition from Myntra and Amazon is real!

**Case studies of small businesses that survived digital disruption** - Real stories, not just big company success tales.

Basically, if someone can translate product management concepts into *practical, applicable tips for small business owners*, I'm interested. Otherwise, all that Agile-Scrum-MVP talk feels like a different world. I need actionable insights, not corporate jargon!

What are you planning to write about?

## Software Engineer

### Sample 1

Honestly, I'm getting tired of the generic "10 lessons from my PM journey" posts that flood my feed. What I actually want to see:

**Real talk about PM transitions** - How do engineers actually break into PM roles? What's the day-to-day reality vs the glamorized version? I'm considering this shift myself but most content feels like gatekeeping or oversimplification.

**Technical PM content** - Posts about API design decisions, working with engineering teams on architecture tradeoffs, how to review PRs as a PM. The intersection of tech and product, not just "user empathy" fluff.

**Salary transparency** - Actual comp discussions for PM roles at different levels. Everyone's secretive about this and it's frustrating when you're trying to plan your career.

**India-specific product challenges** - Tired of Silicon Valley-centric advice. What about building for tier-2 cities, dealing with low bandwidth, payment failures, regional language support?

**Honest failure stories** - Not the humble-brag kind, but actual postmortems. What went wrong, what would you do differently?

Less motivational quotes, more tactical insights. If someone's sharing a framework, show me how they actually used it, not just the pretty diagram.

### Sample 2

Honestly, I'm tired of the generic "10 traits of great PMs" posts that flood my feed. What I actually want to read:

**Real salary progression stories** - like "How I went from SDE-2 to PM at a Series B startup" with actual numbers. The TC (total compensation) transparency helps me plan my potential pivot.

**Day-in-the-life content that's honest** - not the glamorized version. Do PMs actually have better work-life balance than engineers? What's the meeting load really like?

**Technical PM vs Product PM clarity** - I'm decent at coding but wondering if I should stay technical or go full product. Need posts from people who've made this switch from backend engineering specifically.

**Interview prep that's India-specific** - most PM content is very US-centric. What do Flipkart, Swiggy, or CRED actually ask? What's the case study format at Indian startups vs MNCs here?

**Realistic transition timelines** - how long should I stay in engineering before moving? Is 3 years too early?

Skip the motivational quotes and "customer obsession" gyaan. Give me actionable career intel with real examples from the Bangalore/Indian tech ecosystem.

### Sample 3

Honestly, I'm pretty tired of the typical LinkedIn PM posts - you know, the "10 lessons from my failed startup" or "How I got into FAANG" humble brags. 

What I actually want to read:

**Real talk about tech-to-PM transitions** - I'm considering this move but most posts are either too vague or gatekeepy. Show me actual frameworks you use, not just buzzwords.

**Salary benchmarks and negotiation tactics** - The secrecy around PM compensation in Indian companies vs MNCs is frustrating. Give me real numbers.

**Day-in-the-life content that's honest** - Not the glamorized version. How do you actually prioritize features when engineering says everything will take 3 sprints?

**Product thinking applied to Indian problems** - Tired of Silicon Valley case studies. Talk about building for Tier 2/3 cities, dealing with low bandwidth, regional languages.

**Cross-functional collaboration tips** - How do PMs actually work with engineers without being annoying? This seems like black magic.

Skip the motivational quotes and "customer obsession" platitudes. I can read those in company emails already. Give me actionable stuff I can use if I make the switch, or at least help me understand if PM life is actually better than engineering.

## Startup Founder

### Sample 1

Honestly, I'm drowning in generic PM content on LinkedIn. What I actually stop scrolling for:

**Real failure post-mortems** - Not the humble-brag kind. Like "We built this feature for 6 months, customers hated it, here's the ₹40L lesson." I need to see the actual data, what you'd do differently.

**B2B SaaS metrics deep-dives** - How are other companies handling pricing experiments? What's working for enterprise sales cycles? Conversion rates from freemium to paid? Real numbers, not theory.

**Hiring/retention playbooks** - How do you structure PM compensation when you're pre-PMF? Equity vs cash splits? We're trying to hire our first product person and I'm honestly winging it.

**AI integration case studies** - Everyone's talking about AI features but who's actually seeing ROI? What's the implementation cost vs customer willingness to pay?

**Regulatory navigation** - How are PMs dealing with data localization, RBI guidelines, compliance without killing velocity?

I skip anything that feels like a LinkedIn course ad or has "10 frameworks every PM should know" energy. Give me tactical, India-specific, with actual outcomes. Tag the company, show screenshots, share Notion docs. That's what gets me to DM someone.

### Sample 2

Honestly, I'm constantly looking for tactical PM content that I can immediately apply or share with my product team. Here's what stops my scroll:

**Framework posts that actually work** - Not generic "how to prioritize" stuff, but real examples like "Here's the exact RICE scoring we used to decide between features X and Y, and what happened after."

**B2B SaaS-specific content** - How other companies are handling enterprise sales cycles, feature requests from different customer segments, or balancing product-led growth with sales-led motions. Generic consumer product advice doesn't help me.

**Metrics and benchmarks** - What's a good activation rate for B2B? How do other SaaS companies think about usage vs. revenue metrics? I need to know if we're tracking the right things.

**Hiring and team structure** - When do you hire your first PM? How do you structure product teams at different stages? We're at that awkward 25-person size where I'm still doing a lot of PM work myself.

**Mistakes and failures** - Less "we pivoted and won" and more "we built the wrong thing for 6 months, here's the exact warning signs we missed."

I skip anything that feels like generic thought leadership or humble-bragging without substance.

### Sample 3

Honestly, most PM content on LinkedIn is pretty generic—everyone's sharing the same frameworks and "10 lessons from working at Google" posts. 

What I'd actually read:

**Tactical stuff that saves me time:** How to run effective discovery in a resource-constrained startup, prioritization frameworks that actually work when everything is "urgent," or how to balance tech debt vs features when investors want growth NOW.

**Real war stories:** Posts about product decisions that failed and why. Like "We built this feature for 3 months and got 2% adoption—here's what we missed." The messy truth, not the polished retrospective.

**B2B SaaS specific:** PLG strategies, how to improve activation rates, reducing time-to-value. Stuff from founders of companies like Notion, Superhuman, or Linear who've cracked product-led growth.

**Hiring/team stuff:** How to evaluate PM candidates when you can't pay FAANG salaries, structuring PM compensation with equity, building product culture in early-stage teams.

I skip: Anything with "5 lessons from Steve Jobs," product memes, or overly philosophical takes. Need actionable > inspirational. Also, if it's longer than 3 scrolls, I'm probably saving it and never reading it.

## Traditional Business Owner

### Sample 1

Honestly, I don't spend much time on LinkedIn - that's more for the younger generation and corporate types. My nephew who works in IT is always on it, but for me, business happens through personal relationships and trade networks.

That said, if I were to read something there, I'd want practical advice that helps my business survive in this changing market. Things like:

- How to use technology without losing the personal touch with customers
- Understanding what younger buyers want - my children's generation shops so differently
- Simple ways to compete with online retailers without massive investment
- How to make my business relevant for the next generation if my son decides to join

I don't need fancy jargon or theories. Give me real examples from other traditional businesses that adapted successfully. Show me what worked for a saree shop in Chennai or a hardware store in Delhi. 

Most product management content I've seen talks about apps and software - that's fine, but can someone explain how these principles apply to a 60-year-old textile business? That would actually be useful.

My time is limited - I'd rather meet suppliers over chai than scroll through posts.

### Sample 2

*adjusts reading glasses and thinks for a moment*

Honestly, I don't spend much time on LinkedIn - that's more my son's territory. But when I do look at it, maybe once or twice a week on my phone, I want to see things that are **practical and straightforward**.

I'd read posts about:

- **How businesses are adapting to online competition** - real examples, not just theory. Like how a traditional business successfully moved online or created a hybrid model
- **Simple technology solutions** that don't require huge investment - maybe an app or system that helped a small business manage inventory or customer relationships better
- **Case studies from family businesses** - especially how they're passing on to the next generation while modernizing
- **Understanding customer behavior changes** - why people buy differently now, what they expect
- **Cost-effective ways to improve operations** - we don't have budgets like big companies

What I *don't* want is too much jargon or those motivational quotes with someone's photo. Give me real stories, real numbers, real problems solved. And keep it short - I'm usually reading between meetings or while having chai.

My son sometimes forwards me posts he thinks I'll find useful. That's actually how I learn most from LinkedIn!

### Sample 3

*adjusts reading glasses and thinks*

You know, I'm not very active on LinkedIn - my nephew keeps telling me I should be, but honestly, I find it confusing. Most of my business runs on relationships and phone calls, not social media.

But when I do scroll through, what catches my eye are practical things I can actually use. Like:

- How are other wholesale businesses using technology without losing the personal touch? I need to understand WhatsApp Business, these payment apps, inventory systems - but explained simply, not with all that technical jargon.

- Stories about traditional businesses adapting to online competition. How do I compete with these Amazon-Flipkart types while keeping my loyal customers?

- Tips on managing costs and improving margins. Rent is killing us in Dadar, labor costs are up, and buyers want lower prices.

I don't care much about fancy frameworks or Silicon Valley startup stories - that's a different world. I want real examples from people in manufacturing, trading, wholesale. Show me what worked for someone like me.

And please, write in simple English! Half these posts use words I need to Google. I'm running a business, not writing a thesis.
