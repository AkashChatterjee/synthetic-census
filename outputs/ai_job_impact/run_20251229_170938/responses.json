      "Honestly? I'm both hopeful and worried. \n\nI think I'll still be here\u2014kids need human connection, someone to challenge them, to notice when they're struggling with more than just Shakespeare. But the job itself? It's already changing fast.\n\nIn five years, I imagine I'll be less of a lecturer and more of a... guide? Facilitator? Students will have AI tutors that can explain iambic pentameter perfectly at 2am. My role will be teaching them *why* literature matters, how to think critically about what AI tells them, how to develop their own voice instead of just prompting their way through assignments.\n\nThe grading might actually get easier\u2014AI can help flag plagiarism and even provide first-pass feedback. But I'll need to design completely different assessments. More Socratic seminars, in-class writing, projects that require genuine creativity and human judgment.\n\nWhat worries me? The district seeing AI as a way to increase class sizes or cut positions. And honestly, keeping up with this pace of change on a teacher's salary and schedule is exhausting. We need serious professional development, not just a one-hour workshop.\n\nI'm adapting, but I didn't sign up to reinvent my entire curriculum every two years."

      "Honestly? Probably not that different from today, despite what the headlines say.\n\nWe've been using AI for years\u2014CAD systems for mammography, automated bone age assessments, lung nodule detection. The new stuff is incrementally better, not revolutionary. In 5 years, I expect more sophisticated triage algorithms, better automated measurements, maybe some preliminary draft reports for straightforward cases.\n\nBut here's what won't change: I'm still the one integrating clinical context, comparing to priors, catching the subtle findings, talking to clinicians about complex cases, and signing my name to the interpretation. The liability is mine. When there's a PE on CTA and an incidental renal mass, AI might flag both, but I'm deciding what matters for *this* patient right now.\n\nWhat will change is efficiency. I might read 20% more studies. The boring, repetitive stuff gets faster. That's good\u2014I'd rather spend time on the interesting cases and teaching residents.\n\nThe existential threat narrative is exhausting. Show me an AI that can handle a 2am stroke protocol with a confused patient, artifact-laden images, and a neurologist calling for a real-time read. I'll wait."

      "Honestly? I think it'll be a mixed bag. We're already seeing more self-checkout and automated inventory systems, so that trend's definitely continuing. I could see AI helping with scheduling\u2014God knows our current system is terrible at predicting when we'll actually be busy.\n\nThe warehouse side will probably get more automated. We've already got some smart systems tracking stock, but I bet in 5 years there'll be robots doing more of the heavy lifting and restocking. That's actually fine by me\u2014less back injuries for my team.\n\nWhat worries me is corporate will probably push even harder to cut floor staff, thinking AI can handle everything. But like... customers still need actual humans when they can't find something or have a problem. Self-checkout is great until it's not, you know? Then they need ME to fix it.\n\nI'm hoping to be a store manager by then, and honestly, I think the management side stays pretty human. You can't automate dealing with difficult customers, coaching employees, or making judgment calls when weird situations pop up\u2014which is literally every day in retail.\n\nThe real question is whether they'll use AI as an excuse to keep wages low. That's my biggest concern."

      "Honestly? I think the day-to-day coding part gets way faster but also way less of my actual job. I'm already spending maybe 30% less time on boilerplate and routine CRUD stuff thanks to Copilot and Cursor. That trend accelerates.\n\nWhat I think happens: The \"translate requirements into working code\" part becomes almost trivial for standard stuff. My value shifts hard toward architecture decisions, understanding business context, debugging weird edge cases, and honestly just knowing what to build and why. The AI can't sit in planning meetings and figure out that the PM's requirements are actually solving the wrong problem.\n\nI'm less worried about being replaced and more worried about the junior pipeline drying up. How do new devs get good if they skip the reps? That could actually make experienced devs more valuable short-term, but it's a weird spot.\n\nBiggest change: I think \"prompt engineering\" becomes as important as knowing algorithms. And I'll probably be managing/reviewing AI-generated code more than writing from scratch. \n\nStill not starting that company though\u2014too much golden handcuffs with this TC and the market uncertainty."

      "Look, I've been hearing about robots taking my job since 2015, maybe earlier. Every year it's \"five more years\" and here I am, still driving.\n\nHere's what people don't get: I don't just drive. I'm dealing with loading docks where the forklift guy doesn't speak English, I'm checking cargo securement in ice storms, I'm backing into tight spaces that weren't designed for a 53-footer, I'm handling paperwork at weigh stations, dealing with breakdowns in the middle of nowhere. Last month I had to reroute around a wildfire using back roads that aren't on any GPS.\n\nCould AI drive on the interstate? Maybe, in perfect weather. But that's like 30% of what I actually do.\n\nWhat I *do* think will happen is more automation on the easy routes\u2014like those big distribution runs on I-40 between major hubs. That might push more drivers like me into the harder regional work, which means more competition for those jobs and probably lower pay.\n\nThe guys I worry about are the younger drivers just starting out. They might not get those 20 years I've had to build up savings and pay off equipment. That's the real problem nobody's talking about."
