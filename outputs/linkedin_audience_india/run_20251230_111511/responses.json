      "**1. The Product Manager's Dilemma in Platform vs. Product Organizations**\n\nI rarely see honest discussions about how the PM role fundamentally differs\u2014and often conflicts\u2014between platform companies and product companies. Most PM content is Silicon Valley gospel that doesn't translate to enterprise contexts.\n\n**What I'd want to learn:**\n- How PMs navigate when engineering owns the roadmap (common in platform companies) vs. when PM drives vision\n- The political economy of resource allocation when you're building internal platforms vs. customer-facing products\n- Career trajectory implications\u2014why platform PMs often struggle moving to product roles and vice versa\n- How compensation and influence actually differ, not the LinkedIn fantasy version\n\n**2. Post-PMF Product Management: What Actually Changes**\n\nEveryone obsesses over finding product-market fit. Almost no one writes about the completely different skillset required after you have it\u2014when you're managing a \u20b9500 crore product line with enterprise customers and technical debt.\n\n**What I'd want to learn:**\n- How prioritization frameworks break down at scale (most are designed for 0-1, not 1-100)\n- Managing conflicting stakeholder needs when you have 50+ enterprise clients each paying crores\n- The shift from innovation theater to operational excellence and margin improvement\n- When to kill features customers love but that destroy unit economics\n\n**3. The AI PM Reckoning: Which PMs Survive the Capability Shift**\n\nNot another \"how to use ChatGPT as a PM\" post. I want someone to honestly discuss which PM capabilities become commoditized and which become more valuable.\n\n**What I'd want to learn:**\n- Which PM activities AI genuinely automates vs. where it's just hype (my hypothesis: user research synthesis and competitive analysis are first to go)\n- How the PM-Engineer dynamic shifts when engineers have AI pair programmers that can prototype faster than PM can spec\n- Whether \"technical PM\" becomes redundant or more critical\n- What this means for PM hiring, team structures, and the 10,000 PMs we've hired in Indian IT\n\nThese would get my engagement because they challenge conventional wisdom with operational reality.",
      "Here are three product management topics I'd genuinely engage with:\n\n**1. Product Management in Services vs. Product Companies**\nMost PM content assumes product companies, but we're a services giant managing hundreds of client products simultaneously. I'd value insights on: How do you build PM excellence when your PMs are client-embedded? What metrics actually matter when you don't own the P&L? How do you create a PM career path that doesn't just mirror client structures? The talent arbitrage challenge - our best PMs often leave for product companies. This affects our entire industry but nobody discusses it candidly.\n\n**2. The PM-Engineering Partnership at Scale**\nBeyond the usual \"PMs and engineers should collaborate\" platitudes. I want to see: How do senior PMs and VPs of Engineering actually divide strategic territory? When product vision conflicts with technical debt reality, who wins and why? At 200+ engineers, the PM-Eng interface becomes organizational design. I rarely see authentic discussion of the tensions, trade-offs, and power dynamics that emerge at scale.\n\n**3. Building PM Capabilities in Traditional Enterprises**\nMost PM wisdom comes from Silicon Valley. But how do you introduce product thinking in a 30-year-old services company with delivery-first DNA? Real stories about organizational resistance, measurement frameworks that convince CFOs, and career paths that retain talent would be invaluable.\n\nThese would earn my comment and share.",
      "**1. The Product Manager as Organizational Translator**\n\nI rarely see substantive posts about how product managers bridge the fundamental language gaps between engineering, business, and customer-facing teams. Not the superficial \"PMs wear many hats\" content, but deep exploration of:\n\n- How do exceptional PMs translate technical constraints into business opportunities rather than just limitations?\n- What frameworks exist for converting customer emotional needs into engineering requirements without losing fidelity?\n- How does this translation function scale (or break) as organizations grow from 50 to 5,000 people?\n\nI'd particularly value case studies showing how this translation capability becomes a competitive advantage, or conversely, how its absence creates organizational debt that's invisible until it's catastrophic.\n\n**2. Product Decisions Under Irreconcilable Stakeholder Conflict**\n\nEveryone writes about \"stakeholder management\" and \"alignment,\" but the messy reality is that sometimes Sales wants A, Engineering wants B, and Finance wants C\u2014and all three are legitimately right from their perspectives.\n\nI want to see:\n- Real scenarios where product leaders made calls that angered powerful stakeholders but proved correct long-term\n- Decision frameworks for when consensus is impossible or counterproductive\n- How senior product leaders build credibility to make unpopular calls and survive politically\n\nThis is about the courage and judgment required at senior levels, not just facilitation skills.\n\n**3. Product Management's Contribution to Enterprise Valuation**\n\nWhat's the quantifiable impact of product management excellence on company valuation multiples? I see endless content about features and roadmaps, but almost nothing connecting PM practices to metrics that matter in boardrooms:\n\n- How do product velocity, technical debt management, and platform decisions affect revenue quality and predictability?\n- What product metrics correlate with higher valuation multiples in M&A or public markets?\n- How should boards evaluate CPO effectiveness beyond surface-level product metrics?\n\nThis would help me better evaluate product leadership in acquisition targets and understand what \"world-class product management\" actually means in financial terms."

      "Here are three topics I'd love to see more PM content about:\n\n**1. \"The Hidden Costs of Feature Bloat: When PMs Should Say No\"**\nI rarely see honest discussions about feature prioritization failures. I want to learn: How do successful PMs measure the actual cost of maintaining features nobody uses? What frameworks help them resist stakeholder pressure? How do they calculate the \"design debt\" that accumulates? As a designer, I constantly see products becoming cluttered because PMs can't say no. Real examples of features that were *removed* and the business impact would be gold.\n\n**2. \"How PMs and Designers Should Disagree (Productively)\"**\nMost content shows perfect PM-Designer harmony, but that's not reality. I want tactical advice: When should designers push back on business requirements? How do great PMs handle it when user research contradicts their assumptions? What does healthy conflict look like? I need to understand the PM perspective better to collaborate more effectively and know when I'm being too precious about design vs. when I should fight harder.\n\n**3. \"Product Metrics That Actually Changed Our Roadmap\"**\nEveryone talks about being \"data-driven\" but I see few specific examples. Show me: Which unexpected metric revealed a problem? How did qualitative research contradict the numbers? What metrics did you *stop* tracking? This helps me understand what data PMs truly value when making decisions.",
      "Here are my top three underexplored topics I'd love to see more PMs write about:\n\n**1. \"The messy middle: How PMs actually prioritize when everything is urgent\"**\nNot the framework posts (RICE, ICE, etc.) but the real politics and trade-offs. I want to learn: How do you handle when the CEO wants feature X, your biggest client threatens to churn without feature Y, and your data says users need feature Z? What's the actual conversation like? How do you document decisions when stakeholders disagree? This would help me understand my PM clients better and design solutions that account for organizational reality, not just user needs.\n\n**2. \"When user research contradicts business goals: A PM's dilemma\"**\nAs a designer, I constantly face this but rarely see PMs discuss it openly. I want to learn: How do you navigate when research shows users want simplicity but business needs monetization features? What frameworks help you balance? How do you bring design and business teams together? This would make me a better strategic partner to my PM clients.\n\n**3. \"The artifacts PMs actually use daily (not the ones we're taught)\"**\nBeyond PRDs and roadmaps - what documents, spreadsheets, or tools actually run your day? I want to see screenshots of your messy Notion pages, your stakeholder tracking sheets, your decision logs. This would help me create better deliverables that integrate into PM workflows.",
      "**1. \"How PMs Actually Communicate Design Feedback (and What Designers Wish They Knew)\"**\n\nI rarely see honest conversations about the PM-designer dynamic. Most content is either too diplomatic or complaining. I want to learn: What mental models do PMs use when they push back on design decisions? How do great PMs balance user needs, business constraints, and technical limitations when giving feedback? What's the difference between feedback from a PM who gets design versus one who doesn't? \n\nThis would help me anticipate objections better, speak the PM's language, and choose which clients to work with. I'd engage heavily and probably create a counter-post from the designer's perspective.\n\n**2. \"Product Decisions That Failed Because of Missing Design Input (Real Stories)\"**\n\nEveryone shares success stories. I want the messy truth about products that shipped without proper design involvement and what happened. Specific metrics, team dynamics, how they recovered. This would teach me how to articulate design's business value to skeptical clients and identify red flags early in client conversations.\n\n**3. \"How PMs Prioritize Between Fixing UX Debt vs. New Features\"**\n\nThe eternal tension. I want frameworks, real tradeoffs, how they quantify UX debt impact, and how they sell design improvements to stakeholders. This would help me position design work as strategic, not just aesthetic, and understand client constraints better."

LinkedIn's algorithm shows me mostly HR, talent, and leadership content since that's what I engage with.\n\nThat said, where product management DOES intersect with my world and I'd genuinely engage:\n\n**1. \"How Product Teams Should Partner with HR During Hypergrowth\"**\nI'd want to learn: How do product leaders think about team composition vs. just headcount? What skills do they actually need vs. what job descriptions say? How do they onboard PMs to maintain product quality when scaling fast? This would help me recruit better and structure teams more strategically.\n\n**2. \"The Talent Architecture Behind Successful Product Organizations\"**\nExpecting: Real talk about IC vs. management tracks for PMs, how to structure product teams (squad models, feature teams, platform teams), and what competencies matter at each level. This directly impacts how I design career frameworks and development programs.\n\n**3. \"Why Product Managers Quit (And What We Did About It)\"**\nI'd learn: Retention insights specific to PM roles - is it about autonomy, impact visibility, or growth opportunities? How do product leaders create meaningful career paths? \n\nThese would be goldmines because they bridge product and people strategy.",
      "I appreciate the question, but I need to redirect you a bit - I'm an HR professional, not a product manager, so product management content isn't really in my wheelhouse on LinkedIn!\n\nHowever, if you're asking what **HR-related topics** I wish more people would write thoughtfully about, here are three I'd love to see:\n\n**1. The messy reality of performance management transformation**\nNot \"we moved to continuous feedback and it's amazing!\" but the actual challenges: How do you handle managers who resist change? What do you do when employees game the new system? How long did behaviour change actually take? I want the 6-month and 12-month retrospectives with real data on what flopped.\n\n**2. Talent acquisition for niche technical roles in tier-2 cities**\nEveryone writes about hiring in Bangalore/Gurgaon, but what about building tech teams in Pune, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad? How do you compete with remote-first companies? What's your actual cost-per-hire? How do you build employer brand when you're not a unicorn?\n\n**3. HR's role when layoffs are inevitable**\nThe honest conversations about balancing business needs with humanity. How do you maintain trust? Support remaining employees? Handle your own moral conflict? Less \"we're a family\" rhetoric, more real talk about navigating impossible situations.\n\nWant me to elaborate on any of these from an HR perspective?",
      "I appreciate the question, but I need to be honest - as an HR professional, product management isn't really my domain or something I actively seek out on LinkedIn. My feed is curated around HR, people operations, and organizational development topics.\n\nThat said, where product management *does* intersect with my work is around:\n\n**1. How product managers handle team dynamics and cross-functional collaboration**\nNot the typical \"collaboration is important\" fluff, but real talk about: How do you manage engineers who don't respect timelines? What do you do when design and engineering are at loggerheads? How do you build psychological safety in product teams? I'd want frameworks for managing conflict and building high-performing cross-functional teams that I could adapt for HR contexts.\n\n**2. How product orgs structure career paths and retain top PM talent**\nWhat does the IC track vs management track look like in product? How do you prevent mid-level PMs from leaving? What skills development actually works? How do you hire for product sense vs just domain expertise? This directly impacts my talent strategy.\n\n**3. How product thinking applies to employee experience design**\nTreating employees as \"users\" of HR programs - how do PMs approach user research, iteration, and measuring success that HR could learn from? \n\nThese would be genuinely useful to me."

The PM-Marketing Handoff: Why Product Launches Keep Failing**\nI rarely see honest breakdowns of how product and marketing teams actually collaborate (or don't). I want to learn: How do high-performing teams structure pre-launch collaboration? What documentation actually helps marketing understand user pain points vs. feature lists? When should marketing be involved in product roadmap discussions? At what stage of development should go-to-market planning begin? Most content is either PM-centric or marketing-centric, but the messy middle is where launches succeed or die.\n\n**2. How PMs Decide What to Build Based on Market Signals (Not Just User Requests)**\nI'm curious about the frameworks PMs use to balance user feedback, competitive intelligence, and market trends. Specifically: How do you weight qualitative vs. quantitative signals? How do you identify when users are asking for features that won't actually drive retention or acquisition? What market research actually influences roadmaps vs. what gets ignored? This would help me understand product prioritization better and align marketing strategies earlier.\n\n**3. Product Metrics That Marketing Should Actually Care About (Beyond MAU/DAU)**\nMost PM content focuses on engagement metrics, but what product health indicators should inform marketing strategy? I want tactical insights on activation metrics, feature adoption curves, user journey drop-offs, and cohort retention patterns that could reshape campaign targeting or messaging.",

I want to learn: How do successful product teams brief marketing with actual positioning insights (not just feature lists)? What does a good product brief look like with user research, competitive analysis, and the *emotional* job-to-be-done? How early should marketing be involved in the roadmap? I've launched products where we got a deck 2 weeks before launch with zero customer insights - there has to be a better way.\n\n**2. How Product Managers Actually Use Customer Data vs. How Marketers Should**\nPMs obsess over in-app behavior, cohort retention, and feature adoption. Marketers focus on acquisition metrics. I want real examples of: Which product metrics should inform marketing messaging? How do you translate product analytics into campaign angles? What customer insights live in product data that could transform our ad creative or landing pages?\n\n**3. Building Products for Virality: The Product Decisions Behind Growth**\nNot growth hacks, but actual *product design* choices that enable marketing. Referral mechanics, share-worthy moments, social proof elements. Give me the Notion/Calendly/Canva case studies with specific product decisions that made marketing 10x easier.\n\nWould engage heavily with tactical, example-driven content here.",

What frameworks actually work for shared OKRs? How do you balance marketing's need for \"big launches\" with iterative product development? Real examples of when this broke down and what fixed it.\n\n**2. How PMs Actually Use Data (The Unglamorous Truth)**\nEveryone posts about being \"data-driven\" but I want the tactical stuff: Which metrics did you track that turned out to be vanity metrics? How do you prioritize when qualitative user feedback contradicts quantitative data? What's your actual dashboard look like daily vs. what you present to leadership? I need to understand the messy decision-making process, not just the polished outcome.\n\n**3. Product Decisions That Hurt Growth But Were Still Right**\nShow me the features you killed despite user demand, or the technical debt you prioritized over new features. What were the trade-offs? How did you sell this internally? What happened 6 months later? This would help me understand long-term thinking versus short-term growth metrics."

The Consultant-to-PM Transition Playbook**\nMost content is generic (\"learn SQL, understand users\"). I want the real story: How do you translate consulting frameworks into product thinking? What's fundamentally different about stakeholder management when you own outcomes vs. give recommendations? How do top consultants actually prepared for PM interviews at product companies? What skills transferred seamlessly vs. what required complete rewiring? I'm considering this path and need honest, tactical insights beyond surface-level career advice.\n\n**2. How PMs Navigate Politics in Mid-Sized Indian Tech Companies**\nEveryone talks about building at Google or early-stage startups. But what about the messy middle - companies like Razorpay, CRED, or Swiggy at 500-2000 people? How do PMs balance founder preferences vs. data? Navigate engineering teams stretched thin? Make trade-offs when growth targets conflict with product quality? This is where I might actually land, not at Meta.\n\n**3. Product Metrics That Actually Predicted Business Failure**\nVanity metrics discussions are overdone. I want post-mortems: What did the dashboard show before a product died? Which leading indicators were ignored? Real examples with numbers. As a consultant, I'm trained to find early warning signs - curious how this applies in product.\n\nWould definitely engage deeply with these.",
      "Here are three product management topics I'd love to see more substantive content about on LinkedIn:\n\n**1. The Consulting-to-PM Transition: What Actually Transfers**\nEveryone talks about \"transferable skills\" but I want the real story. Which consulting frameworks actually matter in PM work and which are useless? How does stakeholder management differ when you own a product versus advising a client? What surprised PMs who made this switch? I'm genuinely considering this path and need beyond the surface-level \"both need strategic thinking\" takes.\n\n**2. Product Metrics That Matter in Year 1-2 vs. Later**\nMost PM content focuses on mature products or generic KPIs. But how do you think about metrics when a product is just finding PMF? When do you shift from engagement metrics to monetization? I'd love case studies showing actual metric evolution with reasoning\u2014not just \"track DAU/MAU.\" This would help me evaluate PM roles and understand what success looks like at different stages.\n\n**3. PM Career Paths Nobody Talks About: Industry PM vs. Platform PM vs. Growth PM**\nThe PM title is so broad. What's the actual day-to-day difference between these tracks? Which builds better long-term career capital? How do compensation and exit opportunities differ?

What surprised ex-consultants most about PM roles? I'm exploring this pivot myself and need real talk about what transfers and what doesn't.\n\n**2. PM Metrics That Actually Matter in Series A/B Startups**\nEveryone talks about North Star metrics for mature products, but what about early-stage chaos? How do PMs balance growth metrics with product-market fit signals? When do you ignore certain metrics because you're too early? What frameworks help prioritize when you have limited resources and everything feels urgent? I want case studies with real numbers and decision contexts, not just theory.\n\n**3. How PMs Navigate Ambiguity Differently Than Consultants**\nConsulting teaches structured problem-solving with defined timelines. Product work seems perpetually ambiguous. How do successful PMs make decisions with incomplete information differently? What mental models help when there's no \"right answer\" and you can't just recommend\u2014you must ship?

I want to see honest breakdowns of:\n- When someone ignored their A/B test results and why\n- How to build conviction when qualitative signals contradict quantitative ones\n- Real examples where \"trusting your gut\" led to breakthrough features\n- The specific patterns that help you know when to override data\n\n**2. \"The PM Skills That Don't Scale (And Why That's Okay)\"**\nAs I eye Group PM roles, I'm realizing some things that made me effective - like being in every customer call or reviewing every PRD - won't work at scale.

I want to learn: How do you distinguish between \"too early to tell\" vs \"this isn't working\"? What leading indicators actually matter? How do you manage stakeholder expectations when metrics are flat? Real examples of products that looked dead but recovered would be gold.\n\n**2. The Product Manager's Relationship with Data Teams**\nWe talk endlessly about working with engineering and design, but the PM-Data partnership is rarely discussed. I want practical advice on: How to scope analytics requests when you don't know what you're looking for yet? How to push back on data teams who want perfect requirements when you're exploring? How top PMs structure their data partnerships differently? What questions to ask data scientists that unlock better insights?\n\n**3. Internal Politics and Influence Without Authority**\nThe elephant in the room. How do you navigate when sales promises features that break your roadmap? When engineering leaders want to rebuild infrastructure while you need customer-facing features? When your CEO's \"brilliant idea\" conflicts with user research?

I've faced this in fintech where users say they want features but usage data tells a different story. Need real examples of navigating ambiguity, not just \"do more customer interviews.\"\n\n**2. Managing Up as a PM When Leadership Doesn't Get Product Thinking**\nMost content assumes you work at Google with enlightened leadership. Reality? Many of us report to sales-driven or engineering-driven leaders who don't understand why we can't just \"add that feature quickly.\" How do you educate stakeholders without seeming condescending? What's worked in getting buy-in for proper discovery when leadership wants immediate execution? Tactical scripts and real conversations would be gold.\n\n**3. The Economics of Product Decisions**\nPMs obsess over user problems but rarely discuss unit economics, CAC payback, or how financial constraints shape product strategy. In fintech, every feature has a cost-to-serve. How do you balance user value with business viability when they conflict?

Most posts glorify hiring a \"rockstar PM\" but skip the messy reality. I want to know: At what ARR did other founders actually let go? How do you transfer the product intuition you've built over 3 years? What decisions should founders still own vs delegate? \n\nI'm currently at that inflection point - we're at $2M ARR, and I'm the bottleneck. But every PM I interview either lacks the context or wants to rebuild everything. I need frameworks for: evaluating PM candidates when you've never hired one before, structuring the first 90 days so they don't just execute your backlog, and knowing when to override their decisions vs trusting their judgment. Real talk about failures here would be gold.\n\n**2. \"Building for Bharat: Product Decisions That Don't Translate from Silicon Valley Playbooks\"**\n\nEveryone copies Western SaaS models, but Indian B2B buyers behave completely differently. I want tactical discussions on: payment terms (90-day credit cycles vs monthly subscriptions), feature expectations (why do Indian buyers demand more customization?), and the role of relationship-driven sales in product-led growth.\n\nSpecifically: How do you design onboarding for users with varying digital literacy?

Building PM Culture in Non-Tech Indian Companies**\nEveryone copies Silicon Valley, but Indian B2B buyers are different. How do you do customer discovery when buyers won't hop on calls easily?

What's the framework for deciding which custom requests to build vs. push back on? How do you balance being customer-obsessed without becoming a services company? Real examples of when saying \"no\" to a large customer actually helped the product strategy.\n\n**2. When to Kill Your First Product (That Got You Funded)**\n\nMost Series A companies are still selling version 1.0 of what got them seed funding. But the market evolves. I rarely see honest posts about founders who had to sunset or dramatically pivot their core product post-funding.\n\nI'd want to learn: What metrics told you the original product was a dead-end? How did you communicate this to investors and the team? How do you manage the emotional attachment when your \"baby\" needs to die? What's the playbook for transitioning customers without destroying trust?\n\n**3. Product Hiring: Beyond the Flipkart/Google PM**\n\nEveryone wants ex-FAANG PMs, but they often struggle in the 0-1 chaos of startups. I've made this hiring mistake.\n\nI'd want to learn: What interview questions actually predict startup PM success vs. big-tech success?

      "Here are three PM topics I'd actually stop scrolling for:\n\n**1. \"How PMs and Engineers Actually Collaborate (Beyond the Jira Ticket)\"**\nI want the real mechanics - how do great PMs earn engineering respect? What questions do they ask in sprint planning that show they understand technical constraints? How do they push back on timelines without seeming clueless? I've worked with PMs who get it and ones who don't. The difference is massive but rarely articulated. Give me specific examples of PM behaviors that made engineering execution smoother vs. ones that created friction.\n\n**2. \"Product Decisions That Looked Stupid But Were Brilliant (with the data)\"**\nNot the usual \"we pivoted and won\" story. I want to see the actual metrics, the internal debates, and why the contrarian call was right. Like why Instagram killed its original check-in feature, or why Slack deliberately kept their product \"slow\" to launch. What data did they have that others missed? This would help me understand product thinking beyond feature requests.\n\n**3. \"When PMs Should Defer to Engineering Judgment (and When They Shouldn't)\"**\nThe boundary is fuzzy and causes so much conflict. Real scenarios where the PM was right to override technical concerns, and cases where they should have listened. This affects my daily life but nobody writes honestly about it.",
      "Here are three PM topics I'd actually stop scrolling for:\n\n**1. \"How PMs and Engineers Actually Resolve Conflicts (Real Examples)\"**\nI want the messy truth - not \"collaborate better\" BS. Show me: How do you handle a PM pushing aggressive timelines when technical debt is crushing the team? What happens when a PM's feature request fundamentally breaks system architecture? How do you say \"no\" to a PM's pet feature without being labeled \"not a team player\"? Real conversations, real outcomes. I've seen too many PMs either be too pushy or too passive - what does good actually look like?\n\n**2. \"The Technical Depth a PM Actually Needs (and Doesn't Need)\"**\nShould PMs understand database indexing? Caching strategies? When should they stop asking \"why can't we just...\" questions? I want a PM's honest take on where they draw the line between understanding technical constraints and over-engineering solutions. Also - how do great PMs ask technical questions without annoying engineers?\n\n**3. \"PM Metrics That Engineers Should Actually Care About\"**\nBeyond the vanity metrics, what product success metrics genuinely correlate with engineering decisions? How do DAU/engagement goals translate to my architecture choices? Help me understand why I should care about your OKRs.",
      "Here are three PM topics I'd actually engage with:\n\n**1. \"How PMs Actually Prioritize When Engineering Says Everything Will Take 6 Months\"**\nI want real frameworks, not just \"use RICE scoring.\" Show me: How do you push back on inflated estimates? What questions expose scope creep vs genuine complexity? How do you negotiate technical debt vs features when your PM doesn't understand the long-term cost? I've seen PMs who get it and ones who don't - what's the actual difference in how they work with engineering?\n\n**2. \"The Technical Depth a PM Actually Needs (From Engineers Who've Worked With Great PMs)\"**\nNot \"should PMs code?\" - that's tired. I want specifics: Do great PMs understand database indexing implications? Can they read system design docs? When engineers say \"this will scale,\" what follow-up questions do effective PMs ask? I want to know what technical fluency looks like from the receiving end.\n\n**3. \"PM-Engineering Conflicts: Real Examples and What Actually Resolved Them\"**\nNot theory - actual war stories. That time engineering wanted to rebuild everything and PM wanted features. How did it get resolved? Who was right? What was the business impact? I want to understand the PM perspective when we're at loggerheads, with real outcomes.\n\nThese would actually teach me something useful about cross-functional dynamics."
