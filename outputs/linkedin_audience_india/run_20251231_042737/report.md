## Question

> specific to product UX and UI suggestions in existing products, write a LinkedIn post that you feel if someone else had written, you'd have really liked and engaged with it. Not more than 200 words.

**The "Delete Account" button that changed how I think about product design**

Last quarter, we audited our cancellation flow. The data was brutal:
- 6 clicks to cancel
- 43% of users who started the flow abandoned it (and just stopped using the product)
- Support tickets up 31%

We were treating offboarding like a dark pattern opportunity, not a design problem.

**What we changed:**
- Reduced to 2 clicks
- Added simple feedback form
- Removed guilt-tripping copy

**The result?**
Churn dropped 18%. But here's what surprised us: NPS from churned users went from 12 to 64. They started referring others. Some came back.

**The real lesson:** We obsess over features that drive growth, but ignore the interactions that build trust. 

Your product's values show up most clearly when users are leaving you. The friction we add "for retention" often just converts disappointed users into angry ones who tell 10 people.

Sometimes the best product improvement isn't a new feature—it's respecting user agency even when it doesn't benefit you immediately.

What's one UX pattern you changed that had unexpected results?

You've been in the industry for 18 years, having risen through technical and leadership roles.

You're also considering board positions and advisory roles.

Perspective on LinkedIn: You see LinkedIn as a platform for thought leadership and strategic networking. You're selective about what you engage with, preferring high-quality content about leadership, organizational transformation, industry trends, and strategic thinking.

# Appendix B: Raw Responses

Each persona was queried independently via isolated API calls. Responses are presented in order of collection.

## Corporate Executive

### Sample 1

Here's a post I'd genuinely engage with:

---

**The $10M question we're not asking about UX debt**

Last quarter, we audited 15 enterprise products across our portfolio. The pattern was striking: teams spending 60% of sprint capacity on feature additions, only 15% on UX refinement.

The hidden cost? Our data showed:
- 23% longer sales cycles (buyers confused by cluttered interfaces)
- 31% higher support ticket volumes (users can't find what they need)
- 40% lower feature adoption (new capabilities buried in complexity)

We're treating UX like technical debt—something to "fix later." But unlike code, poor UX bleeds revenue *today*.

The most mature teams we studied flip this model: they dedicate 30-40% of capacity to simplification and coherence. Counter-intuitive result? They ship more *valuable* features because they're not maintaining complexity.

For product leaders: What if your next quarterly plan started with "What should we remove?" before "What should we add?"

Curious how other engineering leaders are balancing this. What percentage of your team's capacity goes to UX refinement vs. new features?

#ProductStrategy #EngineeringLeadership #UXDebt

**Why I'd engage:** Data-driven, challenges conventional thinking, directly relevant to P&L impact, asks a genuine question I'd want to discuss with peers.

## Freelancer Consultant

### Sample 1

**The "Delete Account" button that taught me everything about ethical UX**

Last week, I tried to delete my account from a popular Indian fintech app. 

The flow?
- Hidden in settings (expected)
- Required me to call customer care (frustrating)
- Agent tried to retain me for 10 minutes (annoying)
- Finally sent a "confirmation link" via email
- Link led to a survey asking WHY I'm leaving
- After survey, got another email saying "deletion in 7 days"

Compare this to Swiggy's flow:
Settings → Delete Account → "We'll miss you" → Confirm → Done.

**Here's what I learned:**

Dark patterns might reduce churn temporarily, but they destroy trust permanently. That user will tell 10 people about their terrible experience.

Good UX isn't just about making things easy when it benefits the business. It's about respecting user agency even when they're leaving you.

The delete flow is where your product's true values show up.

If you're designing retention features, ask: "Am I helping users or trapping them?"

Your turn: What's the worst account deletion experience you've had? Drop the app name below 👇

## Hr Professional

### Sample 1

I probably wouldn't engage deeply with a post specifically about product UX/UI suggestions, to be honest. That's quite outside my core HR focus.

However, if I *had* to engage with such content, it would only be if it connected to something I care about - like employee experience or HR tech tools. Here's what might catch my attention:

---

**Our ATS was driving candidates AND recruiters crazy. Here's what we changed:**

After analyzing our drop-off rates, we realized our "user-friendly" applicant tracking system had a 43% abandonment rate at the application stage.

The UX issues weren't just frustrating candidates - they were costing us talent.

Three changes that actually worked:

1. **Mobile-first redesign** - 67% of our applicants were on mobile, but the form was desktop-optimized
2. **Progress indicators** - Candidates wanted to know "how much longer?"
3. **Save & return later** - Not everyone has 20 minutes in one sitting

Result: 28% increase in completed applications, better quality candidates, and our recruiters stopped getting "your system is broken" emails.

**The lesson?** Bad UX in HR tech doesn't just annoy users - it directly impacts your talent pipeline and employer brand.

What's the worst UX you've encountered in HR tools? Let's call out the vendors who need to do better.

*This works because it ties UX to my world: hiring outcomes and candidate experience.*

## Marketing Professional

### Sample 1

Here's a LinkedIn post I'd genuinely engage with:

---

**We A/B tested our checkout flow for 6 weeks. Changed ONE thing. Conversions jumped 34%.**

The culprit? Our CTA button said "Proceed to Payment"

Sounds harmless, right? Wrong.

Turns out, the word "Payment" triggered loss aversion. Users hesitated. Bounced. Cart abandoned.

**What we changed:**
"Proceed to Payment" → "Complete Your Order"

That's it. Same color. Same placement. Different psychology.

**The breakdown:**
- Week 1-2: 12.3% conversion (control)
- Week 3-4: 16.5% conversion (new copy)
- Week 5-6: Sustained at 16.4%

**Why it worked:**
"Complete" = achievement (gain frame)
"Payment" = losing money (loss frame)

We also tested:
❌ "Buy Now" - too pushy, 11% conversion
❌ "Confirm Order" - boring, 13% conversion
✅ "Complete Your Order" - winner

**The real lesson:** Micro-copy isn't micro. Every word on your product carries psychological weight.

What's one word in YOUR product that might be killing conversions?

Drop your guesses below 👇

---

**Why I'd engage:** Real data, specific test results, actionable psychology insight, and asks a question that makes me audit my own product. Would definitely comment with my checkout copy.

## Mba Graduate

### Sample 1

**Why the best product improvements often hide in plain sight**

Last week, I noticed Swiggy's new "reorder with modifications" feature. Small change. Massive impact.

It got me thinking about how the most elegant UX improvements aren't flashy redesigns—they're solutions to friction points we've normalized.

Three product decisions I've been obsessing over lately:

**Notion's slash commands**: Turned a complex tool into an intuitive one. No tutorials needed. Just type "/" and discover.

**Zepto's live order tracking**: Not just "your order is on the way." You see your rider's name, their current delivery, and realistic ETAs. Anxiety = eliminated.

**Gmail's "undo send"**: Acknowledged a universal human behavior (panic after hitting send) and designed for it.

The pattern? These teams clearly spent time watching real users struggle with small, repeated frustrations.

In consulting, we often chase the big strategic moves. But I'm learning that sometimes the highest ROI comes from fixing the tiny moments that make users think "finally, someone gets it."

**Question for the PMs and designers here**: What's one subtle UX change you've seen recently that made you think "why didn't anyone do this before?"

---

## Product Manager

### Sample 1

**The "Add Payment Method" button that taught me everything about UX**

Last week, I almost rage-quit while booking a flight. 

The "Add Payment Method" button? Buried under a collapsed accordion, below the fold, in a form with 12 fields.

Then I checked our own fintech app. We were doing the same thing.

Here's what we changed:
→ Made primary CTA sticky at bottom (mobile)
→ Reduced form fields from 9 to 4 (progressive disclosure)
→ Added inline validation vs. submit-time errors
→ Showed saved payment methods FIRST

Result: 34% drop in payment abandonment in 2 weeks.

The lesson? We obsess over feature prioritization but ignore interaction prioritization.

Your users aren't reading—they're scanning for the next action. If your CTA requires scrolling, collapsing, or thinking, you've already lost them.

Quick audit for your product:
• Can users complete primary actions in one viewport?
• Are error states actually helpful or just technically accurate?
• Does your empty state guide action or just say "No data"?

Sometimes the best product improvement isn't a new feature. It's making the existing one actually usable.

What's one UX pattern you changed that dramatically improved metrics?

## Startup Founder

### Sample 1

**The "Delete Account" button taught me more about product design than any course ever could.**

Last month, we rebuilt our cancellation flow. Sounds boring, right? 

Our original flow: 6 clicks, 3 confirmation screens, and a guilt-inducing "Are you SURE?" message. Churn rate: 8%.

We were scared. What if making it easier increased cancellations?

So we A/B tested a brutal change:
- Reduced to 2 clicks
- Added a simple feedback form
- Made the button easy to find
- Removed all guilt-tripping copy

Result? Churn dropped to 6.2%.

The insight hit hard: Users who wanted to leave were ALREADY gone mentally. The friction just made them hate us. But the easier flow gave us actual feedback, and 40% of "cancellers" reached out when we fixed their issues.

Best part? Our NPS from churned users went from 12 to 67. These same people now refer others and some have returned.

Dark patterns feel like growth hacks. But trust is the only moat that matters in B2B SaaS.

Sometimes the best retention strategy is making it stupid simple to leave.

What's the most counterintuitive UX decision that worked for you?

### Sample 1

Here's a LinkedIn post I'd genuinely engage with:

**Hot take: Your "improved" UX is probably making things worse.**

Spent 2 hours debugging why our checkout flow had 23% drop-off. Turns out, we "improved" it last quarter.

The problem? We optimized for what LOOKED good in design reviews, not what users actually needed.

Real example: We added a "helpful" address autocomplete feature. Sounds great, right? 

Wrong. It broke for:
- Users with apartment numbers
- Non-standard addresses  
- Anyone who typed faster than the API response

The old "boring" manual input? 94% completion rate.
The new "smart" autocomplete? 71% completion rate.

**Three things I learned:**

1. **Measure before you "improve"** - We had no baseline metrics. Rookie mistake.

2. **Edge cases aren't edge cases** - 30% of our users live in tier-2 cities with spotty internet. Our fancy feature assumed perfect connectivity.

3. **Simple > Smart** - Users don't care about your clever solution. They want to finish their task and leave.

Now we A/B test everything and actually talk to users before shipping.

What's a "UX improvement" that backfired at your company?

**Why I'd engage:** Specific metrics, real failure story, practical takeaways, and it asks a question that makes me think about my own experiences.
